# elm-pagescroll
Scrolling full pages (work in progress, perpetuum-immobile), inspired by http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/, 

was playing around with szabba's animation library (secret), 
when a random post in #random sent me on a programming spree.

roar!! what is it good for? absolutely nothing!

there is a lot of doubt left in me about animating by using css-positioning,
I'd much rather have a graphics-like system back (pretty please), that
feels the same for targets of svg, canvas, 3d or html. 

shouldn't construction and manipulation of 2d and 3d objects be part of a 
language targeting graphical UI development? I really liked `Graphics.Element`!
